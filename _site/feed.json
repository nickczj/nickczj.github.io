It was my gateway to web development - writing code with a web framework I barely understood, following guides to host my app on a server with my own custom domain.Eventually it died after 2 years because I couldn’t fix an issue with my SSL certificate. I got busy and lazy, but gave up mostly because I had no clue how to fix it. Looking back, I’m actually astonished at how little I understood my own code back then. Using tools you don’t understand is dangerous, but nowadays there is a balance between understanding and getting things done.I originally wanted to develop my website with Vue + Go/Java but I’ve decided otherwise because I realised I was more interested in the tech than the product - I didn’t even have any design in mind. Eventually I decided, I mostly just wanted a personal online presence. Hence, this is just a static blog built with Jekyll, hosted on github pages.I still want to play around with Vue + Go/Java, but that’s for another day :)",
